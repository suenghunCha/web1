<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52651651" target="_blank" title="BBC-coronavirus news" >And by 10 May, that figure had dropped to just under 40,000.</a><br><br>

  There are more than 60 testing centres across the city, according to the official Hubei Daily newspaper.<br><br>

  These have a maximum capacity of 100,000 tests a day at most, making it hard to see how a target of testing the entire population in just 10 days could be met.<br><br>

  So the authorities have indicated the tests will not all start and finish within the same 10-day period.<br><br>

  "Some districts [in the city] will start from 12 May, others from 17 May, for example," the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control said.<br><br>

  "Each district finishes its tests within 10 days from the date it started."<br><br>

  And according to a Reuters report on 13 May, preparations for carrying out tests had begun in two out of the city's 13 districts.<br><br></p>

  <p><strong><u>What proportion have been tested already?</u></strong><br><br>

  Wuhan University pathogen biology department deputy director Yang Zhanqiu told the Global Times newspaper he believed up to five million Wuhan residents may have already been tested.<br><br>

  The population of the city - originally 11 million - has also fluctuated over time.<br><br>

  The authorities said up to five million people had left the city for the lunar New Year holiday before it was locked down on 23 January.<br><br>

  The lockdown then lasted until 8 April, but it is unclear how many of these residents have now returned.</p>
